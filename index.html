    <p>A skeptical, pesimistic weather reporter Phil (Bill Murray) and
      his crew go to the small town of Punxsutawney, where the celebration of
      ground-hog day was started. They report on the supersticious prediction of
       the weather and just as they are about to leave, they get snowed in by
       the on coming storm and are forced to stay against Phil's wishes.
       Phil reluctantly stays the night, but when he wakes up the next morning
       He finds himself caught in an endless loop, repeating the same day over
       and over.</p>
